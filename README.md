# Google-Analytics
Clustering, Time Series and Classification on a sample from a Google Analytics Dataset




This Project is based on a sample of a dataset from a google analytics gathering. The objectives of this project were multiple.\
First i analysed the data and make some charts that better represent this daatset.\
Then i did some clsutering to group clients and analyse the groups a bit.\
After that i did some classification. I tried to predict whether the client would or would not make a transaction.\
Then i did some time series prediction on the revenue.\
Lastly i used flask to implement both the time series model as well as the classification model, giving a full report.
